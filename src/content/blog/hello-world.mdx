## Why I Started This Blog

I created this blog to:

- Build a personal brand

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:
1. Technology and programming
2. Personal development
3. Interesting projects I'm working on

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
